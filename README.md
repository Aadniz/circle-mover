# Circle Mover

A proof of concept for how to use Rust and Godot to implement a real time strategy game using a deterministic lock-step simulation.

The game is a simple distillation of RTS games: you can create circles and move them with typical RTS commands.

## Components:

- cm-sim is a standalone implementation of all game logic
- godot is the Godot project
  - imports godot-rust-client via gdextension
- godot-rust-client
  - imports cm-sim as a library
- cm-server is a rust application that synchronizes player input
  - imports cm-sim as a library

In this way the game client and the running the exact same logic.
